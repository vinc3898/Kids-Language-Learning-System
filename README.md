# Let's Learn English!

This is a Java-based English learning system designed for children. The application offers an interactive, fun interface and sound effects to learn various aspects of English through different themes (animals, colors, numbers and fruits).

## Description

The application presents a user-friendly interface with a light orange background and a starry night sky at the top. It features four floating islands, each representing a different theme. Users can navigate through these islands to learn new words related to animals, colors, numbers, and fruits in English.

Each level of the game introduces 8 new words related to the theme. For instance, in the "animals" theme, users might learn words like "lion", "bear", "giraffe", etc. The game uses engaging graphics and interactive sound effects to make learning fun and effective.
